      <h3>Welcome to the official NYU CAS Cohort 15 website!</h3>
      I'd like to throw some awesome events this year and to do that I need your
      help! Here you can suggest events and dates for the cohort. Go crazy!
      Anything's fair game (except events that violate the university's
      policies).
