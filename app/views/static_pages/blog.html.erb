    Happy first week back at school; whether it's here at Washington Square or
    somewhere far, far away at one of our global sites. (Brooklyn?)
    <br><br>

    This past Tuesday, I attended the Residential College Convocation with those
    of you who live in Broome. In the convocation, one of our Faculty Fellow in
    Residence (FFIR) talked about the meaning of family and how that word gets
    tossed around so often that it loses meaning. My parents and brother.
    Broome. My fraternity, Phi Kappa Sigma. Some of the clubs I'm involved in.
    Even the university uses it in much of its literature. All of these use the
    term 'family,' but in very different ways.
    <br><br>

    I'm not here to make us into a family. Neither is Scott or Maddie.
    <br><br>

    I am here, however, to grab coffee with you. And eat Insomnia Cookies with
    you. And maybe even go to Coney Island, see a musical, and explore NYC; all
    with you wonderful people.
    <br><br>

    We're all busy with school and work. I sympathize with you (you can find me
    in Bobst LL1 most days between the hours of noon and 2am). No cohort events
    will be mandatory. I don't intend to burden your calendar.
    <br><br>

    I created this site so my fellow bobfathers can have a more active role in
    planning fun events that they want to attend. We live in NYC. We have a
    $1000 budget. Go crazy.
