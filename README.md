# Bobfathers - Cohort 15
Website for NYU CAS Cohort 15.

Originally, this website was a platform for my fellow cohort members to suggest
interesting ideas for events around NYC. Users do not have to create accounts,
they just have to use their NYU emails to suggest ideas. They also had to
verify an idea through an email, ensuring that the person who suggested the
idea is ok with posting it publicly under their NYU netid.

Now, this is just a static website with the sunset message.
