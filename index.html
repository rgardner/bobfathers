    <p>Dear Bobfathers,</p>
    <p>
      This past year has been a pleasure. It was great seeing some of you at
      Kotobuki and at the Insomnia Cookie session at Bobst back in the fall.
      This semester’s picnic in Washington Square and dinner at La Linterna de
      Vittorio   also served as a nice break from the rush of the spring
      semester. The Field   Day event back in October as well as the very
      successful Chocolate Fest this spring brought students from all over CAS
      together (and the other schools too!)
    </p>
    <p>
      The cohort program is not over, but is transitioning into a new phase.
      There will be information in the fall about next steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were the first class of CAS students in the cohort program. As such,
      CAS has been learned from us what worked and what didn’t, improving the
      program for the rising sophomore class and the incoming freshman.
      Whatever your experience, know that you have helped make the program
      better for the students in the lower grades.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I will no longer be organizing events for the cohort, I would still
      love to get together and hang out. I’ll be in Manhattan this summer and
      would love to grab coffee / go biking / eat delicious food / go
      rollerblading / explore the city with you. My cell phone number is
      425-614-9938.
    </p>
